To build a job portal using Node.js, you can use a wide range of tools and frameworks, depending on your specific requirements and preferences. One popular option is the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), which provides a full-stack platform for building web applications. Here are the high-level steps you can follow:

Set up a postgres database to store job postings and related data.

Use the Express.js framework to build a RESTful API for creating, updating, and retrieving job postings from the database.

Use React.js to build a user-facing front-end application that allows job seekers to browse and apply to job postings.

Implement user authentication and authorization to allow job seekers to create accounts, save job postings, and receive personalized recommendations.

Implement search functionality to allow job seekers to find relevant job postings based on keywords, location, skills, and other criteria.

Use third-party APIs to pull in job postings from other websites and display them on your site.

Optimize your site for search engines to attract more traffic and increase the visibility of your job postings.
